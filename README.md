**Mojang has [officially](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/article/minecraft-snapshot-25w04a) reverted the "fixes" for [MC-271065](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-271065) and [MC-152728](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-152728)**

The "bug" MC-152728 was "fixed" in snapshot 24w44a. This mod reverts this "fix". It re-adds the ability to keep your sprint while:
- Using an elytra (mainly noticeable while you are trying to elytra jump)
- Crouching
- Crawling
- Using an item such as a shield or eating

This mod is **not** a cheat. It does not bypass server-side restrictions. The server still controls whether or not a player is moving too fast. However, this mod may trigger some anti-cheats. Also, if the server supports multiple versions, the effect would be the same as using a client older than 1.21.4.

**In a multiplayer setting, USE AT YOUR OWN RISK**
